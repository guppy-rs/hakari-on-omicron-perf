# Performance data for cargo-hakari on omicron

## Introduction

I'm the maintainer of [cargo-hakari](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-hakari), a manager for Cargo
workspace-hack packages which do feature unification. [Rust RFC
3692](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3692) proposes adding feature unification to Cargo, and
as part of that I wanted to gather some data to establish the performance benefits of feature
unification.

I'm using the largest repository at Oxide, [Omicron](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron), for
this purpose. I've picked a representative set of commands I ran on the repo over the last week.

## Benchmark platform

- Operating system: Linux, Pop!\_OS 22.04 running kernel 6.9.3
- Processor: AMD Ryzen 7950x, 16c/32t
- RAM: 64GB DDR5 ECC UDIMM, 5200MT/s
- Filesystem: source file system is btrfs, compiled artifacts are on ext4; both are on separate NVMe
  drives.
- Commit: [`f0b804818b89`](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/tree/f0b804818b898bebdb317ac2b000618944c02457)
- Rust version: 1.80.1 (pinned via [`rust-toolchain.toml`](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/blob/f0b804818b898bebdb317ac2b000618944c02457/rust-toolchain.toml))
- Linker: `mold`

## Preparation

```
git clone https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron
cd omicron
git checkout f0b804818b898bebdb317ac2b000618944c02457
cargo xtask download all
cargo clean
```

Omicron comes with hakari configured. To test without hakari, run:

```
cargo install --locked cargo-hakari
cargo hakari disable
cargo clean
```

## Commands run

The following commands were run as part of the test. This is a pretty representative sample of commands I've run against my repository in the last week.

1. `cargo build`
2. `cargo build --all-targets`
3. `cargo build -p omicron-common`
4. `cargo build -p nexus-db-queries`
5. `cargo build -p nexus-types`
6. `cargo build -p nexus-reconfigurator-execution --all-targets`
7. `cargo build -p omicron-sled-agent -p sled-agent-types --all-targets`
8. `cargo build -p nexus-reconfigurator-planning`
9. `cargo build -p reconfigurator-cli`
10. `cargo build -p nexus-auth`
11. `cargo build -p nexus-db-queries --all-targets`
12. `cargo build -p 'nexus-db-*' --all-targets`
13. `cargo build -p '*reconfigurator*' --all-targets`
14. `cargo build -p 'oximeter*'`

## Build times

See [`input_data.txt`](input_data.txt).

- The first column is the command index, above.
- The second column is wall-clock time in seconds with hakari.
- The third column is wall-clock time in seconds without hakari.

### Charts

## Build size

The size of `target/debug` after all of the above commands have been run can indicate how many extra builds occurred.

- With hakari, `target/debug` is 55GB after all of the above commands.
- Without hakari, `target/debug` is 78GB.

## Summary

The cumulative time spent without cargo-hakari is roughly 717 seconds, and with hakari is roughly
418 seconds. This is a roughly 1.7x speedup.

Hakari feels even faster than that, though, because a number of the builds with it are no-ops (take
less than a second).

The build size on disk sees a roughly 1.4x improvement, which means less I/O, less wear on the disk,
and less of a need to run `cargo clean` -- which also improves build times in the aggegrate.
